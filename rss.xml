            <title><![CDATA[Don't settle for anything less than your perfection. Living happily requires humility. Recognize the limits of your humanity, but do not surrender to the ideas that hold you back. Be not like those who seek to fit in and be seen as normal. I suggest you seek to be extraordinary, I can assure you that your idea of perfection certainly is. You were born from the stars, designed to chase your dreams, and one day you will return to the great unknown. But until then, while you still have time on this earth, follow your purpose and push beyond the boundaries that separate you from your truth.]]></title>
