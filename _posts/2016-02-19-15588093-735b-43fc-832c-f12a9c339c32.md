Our universe is massive, made up of elements of matter that constitute the diversity of our reality.  These elements are categorized by their density, and relate to each other through the gravitational forces of the universe.  Celestial bodies are drawn together by the waves that bend and distort space and time itself.  Gravity holds together galaxies, and solar systems. It binds us to this earth, and generates the ebbs and flows necessary for the life cycles of the planet.  Gravity maintains relationships that would otherwise drift apart with expansion of the universe. Holding us close together in a galactic dance that allows us to experience others outside of our self, allowing us to reflect in the mysteries of the moon and receive from the power of the sun.
