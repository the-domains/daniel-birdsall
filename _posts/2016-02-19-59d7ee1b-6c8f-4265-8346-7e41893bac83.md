The basic structure of the Universe is space/time. The governing force of space/time is entropy. Entropy is described as a lack of order or predictability with a gradual decline into disorder.  Space has been continually expanding since the moment of the big bang. Decaying from the highly organized properties of singularity, moving through space and time, opening to ever greater distance and disorder.  These principles create the space necessary for our existence, and give contrast the incredible beauty of life.
