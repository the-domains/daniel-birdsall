Don't settle for anything less than the stars. Living is about humility, recognizing the limits of humanity, but not giving in to the average of humanity. There are people who seek to be normal, I suggest you seek to be extraordinary.  You were born from the stars, and one day you will return there. For now just know that there is no reward in playing small.
