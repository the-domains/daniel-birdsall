Your heart knows that you can be happy, content, satisfied. Even the simplest existence is an amazing opportunity to experience the joy of  living.  Nothing is worthy of letting go of pure love for life, but the heart is only half the battle. Your mind knows that there is so much more to see, learn, and do.  You couldn't be fully satisfied without challenging yourself to do something purposeful with your time. What is it that you are capable of when you focus yourself completely.The battle is fought but never won. It is the civil rebellion of the individual. Two bodies fighting for the balance of earth and sky, forever divided, and resolved by universal acceptance.
