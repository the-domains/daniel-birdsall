The purpose of life is consciousness. Life is the organizing force from which consciousness can manifest.  In a universe of chaos, the  organization of life is simply miraculous. The original birth of  life unfolded as an act of chance, born out of the random interactions of the universe. Ever since its original conception, life has been self organizing with greater and greater complexity. Intelligent consciousness has accelerated this random organization into something more than simple chance. Life is no longer dependent on randomness for its survival. Life has a will of its own. A will to survive and to thrive.
