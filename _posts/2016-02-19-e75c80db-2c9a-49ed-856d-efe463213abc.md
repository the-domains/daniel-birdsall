title: "The greatest misconception of the consciousness movement is the idea that the universe is on your side. The idea that the universe is supporting you in your goals to organize and understand your reality is comforting as an individual, but ignores the greater truth needed to understand how life thrives through the manifestation of consciousness. \_It is true that the universe has provided you with the space and forces of opportunity to organize into a being of self awareness, but this phenomenon did not occur through universal design. In fact you have come into being despite the random chaos of the universe which is set against the organization of life. We know this to be true intuitively because we don't find ourselves in a universe filled with other life forms. \_There was a time in our history when we were instinctively proud to be a part of the sacredness of life on earth, and we lived in defiance to the forces that sought to extinguish the flame of consciousness. \_People formed tribes to help them overcome these destructive forces, and the community of human kind was strengthen by the battle we fought to organize against the entropy of the universe. It is time that we re-develop our understanding of what consciousness stands for, and realize that our purpose is to maintain and promote the organization of life in defiance of the decaying nature of the universe. We are the champions of life, and we are privileged to have such a great capacity for knowledge. Let us us leave behind our self destruction in the name of the universe, and unite in living with the purpose of cultivating life despite the decay of the universe around us.\_"
