The greatest misconception of the consciousness movement is the idea that the universe is on your side. The idea that a magical universal force is supporting you,  organizing your life, and helping you to understand your reality is comforting, but ignores a reality of truth needed to understand why life and consciousness exists in a chaotic universe.  It is true that the universe has provided you with the space and forces that provide opportunity for life to organize into self awareness, but this phenomenon did not occur through intentional design. In fact you have come into being despite the random chaos of the universe which is not conducive to the organization of life . This is known when we recognize that life forms are not commonly found in the harsh environments of space.  There was a time in our history when we were instinctively proud to be a part of the sacredness of life on earth, and we lived with purpose in defiance of the forces that sought to extinguish the flame of consciousness.  People depended on their tribe to help them overcome these destructive forces, and the community of human kind was strengthen by the battle we fought to organize meaning out of the entropy of the universe. It is time that we re-develop our understanding of what consciousness stands for, and realize that our purpose is to maintain and promote the organization of life in defiance of the decaying nature of the universe. We are the champions of life, and we are privileged to have such a great capacity for knowledge. Let us us leave behind our arrogance of self destruction as the heirs of the universe, and unite in living with the purpose of cultivating life in spite of the harsh universal forces that surround us. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ec79a604dfa0ec69e8d16335411d7dfe420971de.jpg)
