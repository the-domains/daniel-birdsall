The electromagnetic force is a spectrum built on oppositions. It defines the internal properties of an object. Magnetic fields are the governing force of potential, while electricity is the transference of charge and current. The electromagnetic for is a field  of  communication that regulates a natural balance. Opposition is universal, it is what creates the need for relationship. Magnetic fields define us, while electric forces bridge the gap between; heaven and earth, mind and body, heart and soul. Electromagnetic fields are the the basic structures of information, and information is power.
