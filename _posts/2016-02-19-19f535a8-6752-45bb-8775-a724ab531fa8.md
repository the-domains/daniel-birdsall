Heat is movement, and movement facilitates growth. The atoms and molecules of life must have movement in order to survive.  Movement allows life serving principles to unfold. The inanimate life of this planet is no less dependent on the movement of heat.  Plants have a special place in the harnessing of this vital energy.  There stationary existence allows them to store this energy, and their sacrifice provides the sustenance that makes higher orders of life possible.  We move through our life fueled by the forces of the sun, consuming it's energy throughout our growth.  The power of the stars radiate from our body as we organize the greater powers of life. ![](http://img15.deviantart.net/2713/i/2010/302/a/4/__sun___by_rmirandinha-d1zkzn2.jpg)
